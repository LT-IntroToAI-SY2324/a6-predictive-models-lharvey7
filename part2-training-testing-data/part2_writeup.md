# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

The fact that the model was given more data made it more effective than the model in the previous lesson, since more data is going to reduce the error and make the predictions more accurate.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

The r-squaed coefficient is around 0.73, which gives an r value of around 0.85. This means that this model is very accurate as it is quite close to 1, and is more accurate than the other model. 

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
