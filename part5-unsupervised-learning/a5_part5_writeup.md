# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

Blue is "impulsive" because they don't have as much income as most of the customers in other groups, yet spend the highest amount. Red would be named "low" group because they spend less than customers in other groups and make less money. Purple would be the "average" group because it is right in the middle of the other groups in both annual income and spending score. Green would be the "they know they're rich" group because they make a lot of money, and they spend like they make a lot of money. Orange would be the "frugal" group, since they make a ton of money but choose not to spend that much

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

That customer would be in the orange group, towards the very left of it.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

The marketing team might approach the orange group the most because they know the customers in it have a lot more money to spend. A way they might go about trying to influence them into spending more money is by having larger bundles of items that give a slight deal on the price. The store knows that they have the money to buy these types of bundles, and the incentive of them giving a slight deal will hopefully get them to spend on the bundles and therefore spend more money than they would have on just a few items.
