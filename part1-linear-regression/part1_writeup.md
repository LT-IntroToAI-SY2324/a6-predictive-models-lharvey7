After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?

The r-squared value is the square of the coefficient of correlation, and shows the variance of the relationship, This tells you how accurate your model is, because it shows how close the data actualy are to your line of best fit. A higher r-squared value means the model can better predict the relationship. In this case, the r-squared value is 0.6258. This is fairly high, as it gives an r vaue of 0.79, which means this linear regression model is fairly accurate.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

According to the model, the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old is around 137.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I think that this model is fairly accurate, considering its fairly high r-squared value. I don't think it is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on age, since it would be off by a lot quite often and there are a lot more factors that make up blood pressure than just age. The model could be improved by taking more factors into account, since the more factors you take into account, the more accurate of a model you can create.
